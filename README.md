# M.A.R.P.
--Mgusto's Anomaly Randomizer Project--

This will be the home repo of a little project I'm building relating to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly and the mod-packs that run on top of it. The intent is to make a web-based tool that can be used by players to make certain decisions for them, either for the sake of inspiration or for challenge-runs and that sort of thing.

I.e, name generator, faction and starting location picker, a customizable weapon / attachment randomizer system (where the user enters their available weapons / attachments manually), where to go next, and so forth.
