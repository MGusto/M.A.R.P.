    <p>This is a little project I'm building relating to <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly" target="_blank">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly</a> and the mod-packs that run on top of it. The intent is to make a web-based tool that can be used by players to make certain decisions for them, either for the sake of inspiration or for challenge-runs and that sort of thing.</p>
